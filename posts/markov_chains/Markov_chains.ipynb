In the present case the consequence of such systems being limited by their order is perhaps most clearly seen by a simple example of a Markov chain model of text.  For example, suppose we have constructed a word-based Markov model of order $D = 1$, whose transition probabilities have been determined using a large text corpus.  We the apply our model to both of the sentences shown below, to predict the word following \"is\"."
