A given word does not always completely determine the word that follows it.   For example, in the sentence above we could imagine a range of words following the word \"dog\" instead of \"runs\", like e.g., \"eats\".  This would give us the sentence \"my dog eats\" instead of \"my dog runs\", which is a perfectly valid and meaningful English sentence.  Of course there are other words that could follow \"dog\" as well, some of which like e.g., the word \"sighs\" that while valid would be less common than \"eats\".

    "So in summary, while a valid sentence of English words clearly has *ordered* structure like a dynamic system, with each word following its predecessor, there are often many *choices* for subsequent words (unlike the dynamic systems we have seen previously).  Moreover of the choices following a particular word we can reasonably say that some are more likely to occur than others.  In other words, these choices are *stochastic* in nature (*stochastic* means *choices*) - with each having a different probability of occurring.  For example, below we show the four choices of words following \"dog\" in the sentence above assigning (using our intuition) a probability of occurring to each.  Here we suppose the word \"runs\" is the most probable, \"eats\" the next, and so on.  The probabilities shown do not add up to $1$ because there could be other reasonable words that could follow \"dog\" other than those shown here.  In other words, with this order one dynamic system model of text we have is a *histogram* (a discrete probability distribution) over all the possible words that follow 'dog' (as well as any other word)."

Below we show the result of an order $D = 50$ model, which generates precisely the true text shown above it.  This happens for exactly the same reasoning given previously in the context of the word based model: as we increase the order of the model the number of unique input sequences balloons rapidly, until each input sequence of the text is *unique*.  This means that there is only one example of each used to determine the transition probabilities, i.e., precisely the one present in the text."
